# Bayesian logistic regression with variational inference and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo


This repository is associated with the article [Durante and Rigon (2019). *Conditionally conjugate mean-field variational Bayes for logistic models*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06999). Written in Python, this compares the work with the implementation in Pyro(http://pyro.ai/).
